<p style="text-align: justify;">Conduct a simulation experiment and determine the rate constant for the saponification of ethyl acetate (A) with NaOH (B) in a batch reactor at a specified temperature. To study the effect of temperature on the rate constant. To determine the frequency factor and activation energy.
<center>CH<sub>3</sub>COOC<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub> (A)+ NaOH (B)-> CH<sub>3</sub>COONa + C<sub>2</sub>H<sub>5</sub>OH.</center>
It is an elementary reaction. Ethyl acetate is the limiting reactant</p>
